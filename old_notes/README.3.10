NOTE TO PRE-REVISION-3.10 USERS:

1. If you have been using the ALT-a through ALT-z single-key procedure
execution, reread mapkeys/README.

2. Termination of file transfers by SIGINT did not cause termination
of procedfure execution in pre-3.10 versions.  In this version, it does.

3. Several files that previously had to reside in ~/.ecu now may have
system wide defaults in the ECU library directory (/usr/local/lib/ecu).
