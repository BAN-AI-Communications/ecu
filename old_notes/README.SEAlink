ECU implements the SEAlink protocol (by System Enhancement Associates)
by means of a modified source provided by SEA.  I got the original source 
from an early distribution of the fine XBBS by alphacm!sandy.

NOTE: SEAlink is provided as-is. I haven't used it since I
tested it in 1989.  It is still reported to work.
