NOTE TO PRE-REVISION-3 USERS:

There have been *MANY* changes to ecu since revision 2.8.  It is
worth re-reading this file and *at least* the table of contents of
the manual to see what's changed.  No effort has been spared to
remain compatible with the previous version, but some changes
were necessary.

Notably, your pre rev-3 ~/.ecu/phone file must have a special
line added manually to the top of it: #ECUPHONE.  See
models/phone for an example.

In general:

    $i0 = 5
    whilei $i0 != 0
    {
        do 'read-new-man'
        ifs %logname != 'confused'
            break
        $i0 = $i0 - 1
    }
    ifs %logname == 'confused'
