NOTE TO PRE-REVISION-3.20 USERS:

1. The functionality of the "nonansikeys" file is now provided by
the "funckeymap" file.  Conversion may be as simple as renaming
the file.  However, there are differences.

  o You must have a ~/.ecu/funckeymap file (and/or one in the library
    directory)

  o There must be an entry for "ansi" if you are on SCO.
    Previous versions handled SCO multiscreens internally.

2. Termination of file transfers by SIGINT did not cause termination
of procedure execution in pre-3.10 versions.  In this version, it does.

3. Several files that previously had to reside in ~/.ecu now may have
system wide defaults in the ECU library directory (/usr/local/lib/ecu).

4. Starting with 3.20, all keyboards must have a funckeymap entry
(see README.KEYBRD) matching the terminal type of the executing
screen.  Previous versions assumed terminal type "ansi"
indicated an SCO AT-attached keyboard as part of a multiscreen.
Other terminal types required a similar entry in a file named
nonansikeys.  Converting preexisting nonansikeys files to
funckeymaps files can be accomplished by merely renaming the file.
If you are an SCO user, you must also add one entry to the new file
if it is not already there (the old models/nonansikeys did in
fact contain the required entry).  See README.KEYBRD for further
detail.
