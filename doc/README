Unusual characters and excessively long lines in news articles
can cause problems on some installations.  While ECU is guaranteed
unuseful on such systems, news will travel through them to
reach some ECU customers.
The distributed manuals have been fed through the "col -b" filter
to reduce difficulties.

When a patch requires manual changes, the patch set will contain
changes for the nroff source.  However, it is quite, quite
impractical to patch the nroff output itself.

If you do not have nroff and the mm macro set, I will be happy
to mail you a manual with the nroff underlining and bolding intact.
I say happy.  If the demand grows too much, I'll make some
other arrangements.

If there is sufficient interest, I'll make a "nice and pretty"
laser-printed manual available for a nominal charge.
