.*s 1 "Starting the Program"

.*s 2 "Simple Startup - Initial Setup Menu"

ECU may be started in a number of ways through use of
command line switches, but the easiest is to enter
.DS I
ecu
.DE
by itself.
In this case, the screen is cleared
and the following screen, called the
.B setup
.B screen ,
will be presented.
.DS L

  `- logical phone directory entry, phone number or empty -------'


.DE
Several choices may be made by navigating the setup screen.
When you position to a field, helpful text is displayed
on the bottom line of the form.

The initial (default) values for some of the fields may be modified
by command line switches or by the special procedure "_rc.ep".
Also, entering a dialing directory entry name in the 'Destination'
field and pressing Return will override the defaults with the values
in the directory entry.
See the sections related to dialing
and the section in the Procedure Language manual titled "_rc.ep".

.*s 3 "Destination"

If a dialing directory has been configured,
a literal phone number need not be entered.
You may enter a "logical" name matching the name
of a directory entry.

However, on your first invocation,  you'll very likely have
no directory.  You have several options:

.DS I
1.  Enter a literal telephone number, (e.g. 18005551212).
    Hyphens and open and close parentheses may also
    be entered.

2.  Press END to enter open the indicated serial port,
    beginning interactive mode to communicate
    directly with the attached DCE (modem).

3.  Enter a "period-containing" hostname for a telnet
    call (if configured for telnet; see below).

4.  Press ^D to enter the telephone directory to enter
    your first directory entry.

5.  Press ^C to enter command mode immediately (with no
    line attached). This has certain uses, but probably
    not for early use.

6.  Press ESCape to exit ecu.
.DE

.*s 3 "Other Fields"

If your call is an async serial, not telnet, call,
other fields in the setup form apply.

The 'tty' field may be used to select an outgoing line
other than the default.
For important considerations on line choice, see the sections
titled "Choosing a Dialout Line" and "DCDwatch".

The 'duplex' field may be used to select a
duplex value other than the default 'F' (full).

The 'baud' field may be used to select a
bit rate value other than the default selected at Configure time.

The 'parity' field may be used to select a
parity value other than the default selected at Configure time.

.*s 3 "Keyboard Functions"

Special keyboard characters while filling in the
startup screen are:

.DS I
 Enter        terminate entry in a field (or skip to
              the next field if you do not modify it)

 ^B           back up to previous field

 Cursor Up    same as ^B (if the key is available on
              your terminal and environment).

 TAB          move to next field ... if nothing typed in
              the field, do not disturb contents

 Cursor Down  same as TAB (if the key is available on
              your terminal and environment).

 END          proceed with session, dialing remote if
              logical directory entry name or literal
              telephone number entered

 ^D           enter phone directory

 ^C           enter command mode with no line attached

 ESC          quit ecu without starting a session
.DE

.*s 2 "Command Line Switches and Arguments"

ECU can be started in a number of ways:
.DS I
o  with no switches or arguments
       select options interactively; manual command to begin
       connection

o  with switches (excluding -p) and no arguments
       override some defaults for options but still enter
       interactive option selection; manual command to begin
       connection

o  zero or more switches (excluding -p) and one argument
       fully automatic startup to connect to the remote
       specified by the argument (a telephone number
       or dialing directory entry)

o  zero or more switches, with -p the last switch
       fully automatic startup by executing procedure whose
       name is specified by the first argument; the initial
       procedure receives the remainder of the command line
       arguments
.DE

.*s 3 "Usage Summary"

.DS I
usage: ecu [-l <ttyname>] [-b <baud_rate>] [-eon]
           [-h] [-t] [-P <phonedir>]
           [-F name] [-T <trace-level>] [-z]
           [-p <initial_proc> [-d] [-D] | <phone_number>
           <logical> | <hostname> ]
-D unconditionally stop execution when -p initial
   procedure is done
-F sets an alternate funckeymap name for the *keyboard*
-P choose alternate phone directory (<phonedir> must be
   a full pathname)
-T set procedure tracing to level: 0=none, 1=standard,
   2=ECU-debugging
-b choose bit rate (any UNIX rate 110-38400)
-d stop execution if -p initial procedure fails
-e even parity   -o odd parity   -n no parity
-h half duplex ... default is full duplex
-l choose line (/dev/<ttyname>)
-n 
-p execute an initial procedure
-t append NL to incoming and outgoing CR characters
-z if telnet connection, show options traffic 
<phone_number> is either an actual number or a dialing
   directory entry name

If configured for telnet use, if a period '.' appears in
phone number, contact host by that name using telnet; a
trailing period will be removed.
.DE

.*s 3 "Switches"

Many switches are used to override defaults specified
at the time the Configure procedure was used.
Note these defaults may also be overridden interactively if the command
does not specify automatic startup option (-p or dialing argument).
Also, the value chosen by a dialing directory entry or an
initial procedure will override
the Configured default and/or the value specified by this switch.

.*s 4 "-b <baud>"

This switch overrides the default bit rate.
Any valid UNIX rate may be chosen.  
ECU chooses the number of stop bits based on the bit rate.  Rates below
300 baud get 2 stop bits.  Rates 300 baud and above get one stop bit.

.*s 4 "-d"

The
.B
-d switch
.R
instructs ECU to "die" (terminate with error status) if
an initial procedure (-p) fails.  This switch ensures a batch
ECU execution will hang up any connection and terminate if
a procedure error occurs. See also -D below.

Absence of the
.B -d
and
.B -D
switches
causes ecu (upon any completion of the
initial procedure) to enter the 1) interactive mode if a line
was successfully attached by the procedure or 2) the setup screen
if no line was attached. 

.*s 4 "-e, -o, -n"

Normally, ECU starts up with data bits and parity chosen at
Configure time.  The 
.B -e ,
.B -o 
and
.B -n 
.B switches
allow you to override the default.

Since combinations like eight data bit and even parity or
seven data bits and no parity are not in  ECU's
capability to use, the parity selection also dictates the
choice of data bits. Even or odd parity implies seven data bits.
No parity implies eight data bits.

.*s 4 "-h"

Normally, ECU starts up in the full duplex mode.
If half duplex is desired, the
.B
-h switch
.R
is used.

.*s 4 "-l ttyspec"

When ECU starts up, it normally chooses a line as described later
in the section titled "Choosing a Dialout Line".
Specifying the
.B -l
.B switch
overrides the default tty specified
at Configure time.  Depending upon other command line options,
this switch may be nothing more than a hint.

For important considerations on line choice, see the sections
titled "Choosing a Dialout Line" and "DCDwatch".

Two styles of argument to -l allow line selection by two methods.

Of course, no -l is meaningful for a telnet destination.

.*s 5 "by specific device"

The ususal argument to the switch is the base name
of the tty (e.g., "tty1a" or "acu0").  

Note to old users of ECU:
In previous SCO versions of ECU, since ttys were generally all
named with the prefix "tty", ECU allowed you to
omit the "tty" (e.g., "1a" or "4g"). This is no longer the case.

.*s 5 "by Devices type"

Alternatively, if your platform supports
HDB UUCP, you may choose a line by UUCP Devices type by
specifying the type with a leading equals sign.
You must also explicitly set the bit rate with -b (unless
the default bit rate is acceptable).
.DS L
    ecu -l=VoiceDial -b2400
.DE
searches the UUCP Devices file for an entry whose type is
``VoiceDial'' that accepts 2400 baud.

.*s 4 "-p <proc>"

The 
.B
-p switch
.R
causes ECU to execute the procedure <proc> ("<proc>.ep")
immediately upon startup.  Such a procedure is termed the
.B
initial procedure.
.R
It is recommended that, when used, -p be the last switch on the
command line.  All non-switch arguments after <proc> are passed
as arguments to the initial procedure (see the descriptions of
the integer function
.B %argc
and the string function
.B %argv 
in the Procedure Manual).

For example,
.DS L
    ecu -p batchjob remsys 22
automatically executes the procedure command equivalent
    do 'batchjob' 'remsys' '22'
.DE

The initial procedure may read command line options
with functions like
.B %line ,
.B %baud
and
.B %parity .
It is also free to override any of these values it wishes.
See the procedure manual for more information.

.*s 4 "-t"

The
.B
-t switch
.R
instructs ECU to map incoming and outgoing carriage
returns to carriage return/line feed pairs.
This is helpful if the remote connection will be to a
display terminal rather than a computer.  Use of the
.B
-h switch
.R
may also be necessary.

The interactive commands
.B nlin
and
.B nlout
also control this feature.

.*s 4 "-C"

The
.B
-C switch
.R
causes the compile-time configuration of ECU
to be displayed.

.*s 4 "-D"

The
.B
-D switch
.R
instructs ECU to unconditionally terminate when an
initial procedure finishes.  Contrast with the
.B -d
.B switch .

.*s 4 "-F name"

Normally, the TERM environment variable is used to determine the
funckeymap entry (keyboard configuration) to be used.  Sometimes,
the TERM variable is not adequate for identifying your keyboard
arrangement.  The 
.B
-F switch
.R
switch, like the $ECUFUNCKEY environment variable, allows you to
use override the funckeymap entry used.  For more information,
see the section titled "Function Key Mapping (Recognition)".

.*s 4 "-P phonedir"

The
.B
-P switch
.R
causes ECU to begin execution using an alternate 
phone directory.  The default is ~/.ecu/phone.  You should
specify a full pathname if you anticipate using the change directory
command once ecu starts.

.*s 4 "-T level"

The
.B
-T switch
.R
sets the procedure language trace level.  <level> is a decimal
digit.  0 is for no tracing (the default) and 1 is for tracing.
Values higher than 1 are for debugging ECU and have varying effects
from revision to revision.

.*s 4 "-z"

If configured for telnet use, show in-band telnet option traffic on screen.
This is useful for debugging ECU telnet connections with a
host. This feature is controlled by the 
.B telopt
interactive command once ECU is running (although
there is very little telnet traffic after a connection
has "matured").

.*s 3 "Non-Switch Arguments"

Arguments are optional.
<phone_number> or <logical> may appear when the -p switch is absent.
One or more <arg> arguments may appear when the -p switch is used.
These arguments are handled as described by "-p" above.

.*s 4 "<phone_number>"

This type of argument has a digit as its initial character and
represents an actual telephone number to be passed to a modem
dialer program or Dialers chat script.  The string may contain
non-numeric characters if appropriate for a dialer program,
such as dialTBIT or dialgT2500 (see the gendial subdirectory).
For example:
.DS L
    ecu -ltty2a -b 19200 -e 5551212C
.DE
uses tty2a (assumed to be connected to a Trailblazer modem because
of the dialer-specific telephone number) and
establishes a 19200 baud, even parity PEP Compressed connection
after dialing 5551212.

.*s 4 "<logical>"

This type of argument has an alphabetic initial character and
contains no period characters. such an argument
causes the dialing directory entry by that name to be dialed.
The line may be specified by '-l', but if the dialing directory
specifies a line (tty field contains other than 'Any'), the
dialing directory entry will override it.  The '-b', '-e' and '-o'
switches are ignored; the values specified by the dialing directory
entry are used.  The '-t' and '-h' switches are valid and honored
if present.

.*s 4 "<hostname>"

The following holds true only if ECU supports telnet
on your system.
If a period ('.') is present in the first non-switch
command line argument, the argument is treated as a hostname.
An internet telnet connection is attempted to <hostname>.

If you wish to specify a simple hostname (with no domain part)
such as "localhost", append a period to the name (making, for
instance "localhost.").  The period will be removed by ECU.

If a colon followed by a number is appended to the hostname, that number
will be used as the port to contact instead of the default telnet
port 23.

During a telnet session, many async-style parameters simply
do not apply.

.DS L
Examples:
    ecu watsun.cc.columbia.edu
    ecu localhost          search directory for 'localhost'
    ecu localhost.         call my host's telnet port
    ecu localhost.:25      call my host's SMTP port
.DE

.*s 4 "<arg>"

This type of argument is passed to an initial procedure when
the -p switch is present.

.DS L
ecu -p unixlogin user pwd ansi43
.DE
executes unixlogin.ep with arguments 'user' 'pwd' 'ansi43'

For more detail, refer to the description of
.B -p ,
.B -d
and
.B -D .

.*s 2 "Environment Variables"

Prior to starting ECU, it is useful, but not necessary,
to establish two environment variables, ECUPROMPT and ECUHELP.

.*s 3 "ECUPROMPT"

The ECUPROMPT environment variable determines the prompt printed
by ECU when the interactive command key ("HOME") is pressed.
When you first run ECU, try setting it to your name, e. g.,
.DS I
setenv ECUPROMPT Ralph    if you use csh

ECUPROMPT=Ralph           if you use sh, ksh, etc.
export ECUPROMPT
.DE
Then, when you see how it used, you may wish to
establish a more permanent choice in your .login or .profile.

.*s 3 "ECUHELP"

Ordinarily, ECU looks for interactive command help information
in "ecuhelp.data"
(in the ecu library directory, normally /usr/local/lib/ecu).
The ECUHELP environment may be set to the complete
pathname of the ecu help file if an alternate file
is to be used.

The help file is explained later in the section
titled "Online Command Dictionary".

.*s 3 "ECUFUNCKEY"

See the description of the 
.B -F
command line switch and the section titled
"Function Key Mapping (Recognition)".
