NOTE: Many sections of the manual are likely to be inaccurate or
obsolete at any given time until the writer get lots of free
time.  Much of it was written when the program was supported only
on SCO XENIX and UNIX.  Usually, I took the extra time to throw
-something- in the manual and online help.  I did not always go
back and indicate which features are not supported by a later`
port.

Many of the features of ECU were written under extreme time
pressure.  While the program code is usually reliable, the manual
is a joke from many points of view, organization, consistency,
content -- you name it.  You'll see comma splices, incomplete
sentences or even incorrect information.  You may find the
correct information in a README or in another part of the manual.
Of course, there is the code!  If you find information that seems
incorrect, PLEASE mail a report to the author.
