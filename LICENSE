RIGHTS TO USE

This program, it sources, objects and utilities
are in the public domain.

Alas, placing "popular" programs in the public
domain can cause peculiar problems.  As others
adopt, modify and redistribute the code, it tends
to fall apart.  I regularly get mail from folks
who have found fragmented or damaged buckets of
code with my e-mail address in it.  Invariably,
it has come from some off-net BBS where someone
has tried to PKZIP it or something :).

Your license to redistribute this version of ECU
is, of course, unlimited.  Even though I'll spend
hours poring over patches trying to help a user,
my patience with folks who modify my code without
CLEARLY marking it so is at end.  

These are my requests:

1.  If you use or redistribute this program, it
    should retain the ECU name unless you ask me.
	This means the base name of the program
	executable must be "ecu" and the program must
	announce itself with the strings "ECU" and
	"wht@n4hgf".

2.  If you modify the program "substantially" you
    should not redistribute it without asking me.
	For purposes of this paragraph,
	"substantially" refers to changes of more
	than a bug-fix or cosmetic nature.  For
	larger changes, read README.porting and, if
	appropriate, submit patches to wht@wht.net.
	If they "pass muster" (we are usually easy),
	then the changes will be incorporated into a
	released patch level of ECU.

    You can give modified versions to an
	associate, but if he/she gives it to someone
	else, does the fourth party know not to contact
	me for bug fixes?

3.  You are still free to use substantial code
    fragments or entire logical subsections of
	the program in any way you see fit, obeying of
	course any other copyrights and requests made by
	other authors whose code fragments appear within
	ECU.

4.  Anybody who has contributed to ECU
    development will find it awfully easy to get
	my permission to do anything they want with ECU
	("Noooooooooooooooooo ...  not THAT!")
