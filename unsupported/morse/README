This is a driver that works for SCO UNIX V/386 that produces morse code.
It is based on a speaker driver I got from usenet.

To install
----------
As root, make install
You must remake the kernel environment when asked, then reboot

To test
-------
As non-root: make
testmorse is a sound show
usemorse copies from the keyboard to the speaker

You can also:
cat>/dev/morse
-or-
fopen("/dev/morse","w");
fputs("text",fp);
